# InnerSource Obstacles Survey

This R-Shiny based project is for conducting an InnerSource Obstacles Survey for Managers, Repository Owners, and Contributors.

- In page 1, you need to enter your name/email and choose a role. 
- In page 2, you need to rate several obstacles by how severe you think they are and list any other obstacle you might have - The save button saves the result in local storage as a CSV file
- In page 3, you are given customized feedback to address any obstacles you indicated to have found problematic.

The survey is by default in Chinese, but can easily be translated to English from the language selection menu on top-right.
