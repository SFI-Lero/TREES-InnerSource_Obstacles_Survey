# To create this file, use the following command
# library(rdrop2)
# drop_auth()
# This will launch your browser and request access to your Dropbox account. You will be prompted to log in if you aren't already logged in.
# Once completed, close your browser window and return to R to complete authentication.
# The credentials are automatically cached (you can prevent this) for future use.
